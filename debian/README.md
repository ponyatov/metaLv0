## live USB install: Debian GNu/Linux 10.5.0 i386

`metaL` usage so easy as it can be used to do even such light and temporary tasks:
in place of writing Shell scripts or `Makefile` manually we can generate the
generic project with the `Makefile` and provide a list of required programs for
the host system in a few lines of Python code.

sample `anyModule`-based project just to download & install Debian i386 `.iso`
